# (HOMEPAGE), but the overlay's rule is that a pin stays local until a revision
# has actually been built from a GitHub archive URL and its Manifest verified
# on both machines; this is the first revision, so it has not. The bare
# repository on qinda comes first, then either machine's working tree, and
# git-r3 takes the first URI that exists.

# The bar is a Qt application that owns two D-Bus names, streams over a
# WebSocket, reads credentials from the Secret Service, and speaks to IBus and
# AT-SPI through GObject introspection. dbus-python and pygobject are runtime
# imports of src/gabbee/ui/global_shortcuts.py and src/gabbee/ibus_engine.py;
# they are deliberately not in pyproject.toml, because pip would then try to
# build pygobject inside a virtualenv instead of using the system typelib.
